# Twin Prime Numbers Program

Feb 6, 2022


## Objectives in Practice:

- Develop, compile, and run a C++ program that requires C++ repetition control structures including the while loop, do - while loops, and/or for loops that utilize fundamental algorithms studied to
perform common tasks, such as finding the max and min of a data set, counting, summing, tracking a previous value, searching and sorting, reading until EOF, etc. in programs to solve problems.

- Transfer a program to the Unix server, use the G++ compiler to compile a program and execute a c++ program that you have written

- Use the basic set of Unix commands to manipulate files.


## The Instructions That Were Given for the Project:


- Write a C++ program to print all the twin prime numbers below a certain given number. "A twin prime is a prime number (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) that is either 2 less or 2 more than another prime numberâ€”for example, either member of the twin prime pair (41, 43). In other words, a twin prime is a prime that has a prime gap (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_gap) of two. Sometimes the term twin prime is used for a pair of twin primes; an alternative name for this is prime twin or prime pair." See the [Twin Prime Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime)

- Your program should output the number of twin prime numbers found.

### Make sure your program conforms to the following requirements:

1. This program should be called TwinPrime.cpp

2. Include the basic header in your program [Required Header Template](https://canvas.fsu.edu/courses/193490/files/15396772/download?wrap=1)

3. Accept the upper limit from the user (as an integer)

4. Loop until the upper limit number entered is >=1
   
5. Loop from 1 to the upper limit and print all twin prime numbers and the number of twin prime numbers found.
   
6. Add comments wherever necessary

- Follow the course coding standards outlined in Coding Standards_ (COP3363 Introduction to Programming in C++ for Majors).docx [Coding Standards](https://canvas.fsu.edu/courses/193490/files/15396757/download) .


## How to Run the Program:

- Use ```g++ TwinPrime.cpp -o TwinPrime.exe``` and then ```TwinPrime.exe``` in a Linux terminal to compile and run.
