# Ordered Exam Scores Program

Jan 30, 2022


## Objectives in Practice:

- Develop, compile, and run a C++ program that requires the use of C++ variables and if, if / else, if / else if statements, conditional operators, and/or switch statements.

- Transfer a program to the Unix server, use the G++ compiler to compile a program and execute a c++ program that you have written.


## The Instructions That Were Given for the Project:


- Write a C++ program that asks the user to enter in three exam scores as doubles and displays the exam scores in descending numerical order.

- If the three exam scores are all the same the program should tell the user that all the exam scores are equal and exit the program.

- Follow the course coding standards outlined in Coding Standards_ (COP3363 Introduction to Programming in C++ for Majors).docx ([Coding Standards](https://canvas.fsu.edu/courses/193490/files/15396757/download)) .

- Include the basic header in your program Header for Assignments.docx ([Required Header Template](https://canvas.fsu.edu/courses/193490/files/15396772/download)) , and print a welcome message to the user.

- Allow user to input three Exam Scores

- Properly display either the exam scores in descending numerical order or the message that all the exam scores are equal.

- Include comments in your code as required


## How to Run the Program:

- Use ```g++ ExamScores.cpp -o ExamScores.exe``` and then ```ExamScores.exe``` in a Linux terminal to compile and run.
